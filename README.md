# Using movement tracks to infer successful breeding of a precocial bird with machine learning

## Summary 

We are training ML algorithms to infer the breeding success of shorebirds that were not observed on the breeding grounds (i.e., Nateâ€™s spain birds). Additionally, we want to create 1) a manuscript, 2) a model that other researchers can use on their own study organisms, and 3) auser-friendly R package.
